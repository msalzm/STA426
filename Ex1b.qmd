## creating the distribution

the distribution is made with n = 100 and mu = 10. the seed is set to always ensure the same outcome

```{r}
set.seed(210)
distribution <- rnbinom(n = 100,mu = 10, size = 1/2)

```

the mean and variance of the sample is `r mean(distribution)` and `r var(distribution)` respectively.

## creating the histograms

the linear and logarithmized histograms are made.

```{r}
hist(distribution, main = "linear histogram" )
hist(log(distribution), main = "log(x) histogram")
```
